# Leaky Integrate and Fire Neuron Simulation to Model Conductance Stimulus and Postsynaptic Conductance Time Series

Use of the LIF neuron model to simulate response to presynaptic forms of stimulus.

This repository includes two files:

-  mylifneuron.py is a module including lif simulation functions.
-  lif-neuron-simulation-proj.ipynb runs the simulation.

Dependencies:

-  Python 3

-  Jupyter Notebook

-  Numpy

-  Matplotlib

-  Scipy
